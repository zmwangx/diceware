INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a simple C implementation of the Diceware passphrase generation scheme
(homepage http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html). This implementation
reads random bits from the /dev/urandom device, which should be available on
most Unix-like operating systems. The 8k word list, diceware8k.c, is an
unmodified copy downloaded from the official Diceware website.

USAGE
-----

To use, call diceware without argument, and it always prints ten random words
from the 8k word list, one per line. (According to the official Diceware FAQ
http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#howlong, eight words should be
completely secure through 2050.)

CAUTION
-------

A physical die is always better than a random number generator. Use this program
only if you don't have a die and can't bother to get one.
