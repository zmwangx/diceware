DICEWARE(1)
===========
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
diceware - secure passphrase generator

SYNOPSIS
--------
*diceware*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program prints ten (cryptographically) random words from the
Diceware 8k word list: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware8k.txt.

For more information about the Diceware passphrase generation scheme,
visit the home page: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html.

CAUTION
-------
If you have a physical die, use it, since it is most likely more
secure than the PRNG (pseudo random number generator) used in this
program. Although, I would say, tossing a physical die fifty times and
consulting the list ten times aren't as convenient as typing
the word ``diceware'', so take your pick.

If you log your terminal sessions, be sure to purge the logs
containing the word lists generated by this program.

----
